### Problem Setup
We all know, as the cases count are increasing day by day bulk testing isn't getting feasible and faster at this rate. This inspired me to create a probabilistic analysis whether a person is infected or not keeping in mind with the list of symptoms as said by the World Health Organization (WHO). üë®üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

### Research Paper
The Research Paper can be found here: [Identification of COVID-19 can be quicker through artificial
intelligence framework ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7151059680918EF9B8CDBCC4EF19C292/S0899823X20000616a.pdf/identification_of_covid19_can_be_quicker_through_artificial_intelligence_framework_using_a_mobile_phonebased_survey_in_the_populations_when_citiestowns_are_under_quarantine.pdf)

| Vomiting | Patient Vomiting (No=0/Yes=1) |
| Runny Nose | Patient Runny Nose (No=0/Yes=1) |
| Diarrhea | Patient Diarrhea (No=0/Yes=1) |

### Choice of Model

The model used for probabilistic analysis for COVID-19 infection is **Logistic Regression**
*  Why is Logistic Regression preferred over other models?
<br><br>No algorithm is generally the best one but in this case, as the output of this problem statement will give either Yes/No, so LR is preferred for Binary Classification. On the other hand, tree based approach were much slower and accuracy is lower than LR.
